- move updaters to own files
- updaters should be initialized *once*, there's no need for them to be determined dynamically
- idea (at least as an exercise) - two passes on the 'items': 1. first pass - assign an 'updater' to the item 2. second pass - call the `update` function
- ~~have a separate make target for the approval tests~~
- do the actual kata
- why does clang not work in vscode?
- should some of this be part of approvals?
- combination approvals
- idea - 2D table iso one line per item: rows are days, columns are items
